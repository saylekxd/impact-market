## Additional Requirements

### KYC Verification Implementation

We need to implement a full KYC (Know Your Customer) ID verification process that is required by Polish law for financial transactions. This verification should be:

1. **Comprehensive** - Including identity verification through official documents, proof of address, and potentially biometric verification
2. **Compliant with Polish Financial Regulations** - Meeting all requirements of Polish AML (Anti-Money Laundering) and financial transaction laws
3. **Integrated with External Provider** - Implementation should leverage a trusted external KYC provider specializing in Polish market compliance
4. **User-Friendly** - The verification process should be as smooth and straightforward as possible while maintaining compliance
5. **Secure** - All sensitive personal data must be handled with appropriate security measures

This is a critical component for the withdrawal functionality as Polish law requires proper verification of individuals before processing financial transactions.

   - Implement multi-level approval for payout requests above certain thresholds
   - Add fraud detection mechanisms for suspicious withdrawal patterns
   - Create IP and device logging for all payout-related actions
   - Implement admin action audit trail for all payout status changes

3. **Financial Reconciliation**
   - Create automated balance updates following successful payouts
   - Implement financial reports for accounting purposes
   - Add transaction categorization for financial reporting
   - Create exportable financial summaries for tax purposes

4. **User-Facing Features**
   - Enhanced payout history with detailed status information
   - Email notifications for each stage of the payout process
   - Payout receipt generation for completed transactions
   - Cancellation options for pending payout requests

   - Develop secure API connections to banking partners for automated transfers
   - Implement bank verification system for new account validation
   - Add support for multiple payout methods (bank transfer, PayPal, etc.)
   - Create retry mechanisms for failed banking transactions

6. **Compliance Features**
   - Implement transaction limits based on user verification level
   - Add suspicious activity reporting mechanisms
   - Create compliance reports for regulatory submissions
   - Implement data retention policies compliant with financial regulations

7. **Testing and Validation**
   - Create comprehensive test plan covering all payout scenarios
   - Develop sandbox environment for testing banking integrations
   - Implement automated testing for critical payout flows
   - Conduct security penetration testing on the entire payout system

8. **Documentation and Training**
   - Create detailed internal documentation for payout processing
   - Develop admin training materials for payout system
   - Create user documentation and FAQs for payout process
   - Implement contextual help within the payout interface

This implementation must comply with Polish financial regulations and ensure secure, reliable transfer of funds to creators while maintaining appropriate financial controls and audit capabilities.
