# BLIK Implementation Guide for Frontend

This document explains how to use BLIK with our Payment Forms.

## What is BLIK?

BLIK is a popular Polish payment method that allows customers to make payments using a 6-digit code generated by their banking application. It's widely used in Poland and has a high conversion rate for Polish customers.

## Using BLIK in Our Application

The implementation of BLIK has been added to our payment system through Stripe's PaymentElement. The existing `StripePaymentForm.tsx` component has been updated to support this payment method.

## How to Test BLIK

1. Select the "BLIK / Inne" option in the payment form
2. When the BLIK payment field appears, use one of these test codes:
   - `123456` - for successful payments
   - `234567` - for payments that require additional authentication
   - `345678` - for failed payments

## Implementation Details

### Frontend Components

1. The `StripePaymentForm.tsx` component now includes:
   - A toggle between card payments and BLIK/other methods
   - `PaymentElement` for BLIK payments (replaces `CardElement` when BLIK is selected)
   - Updated submission logic to handle BLIK payment flow

2. Important changes to `handleSubmit`:
   - Different confirmation methods for card vs BLIK
   - Special handling for additional actions that might be required by BLIK

### Server-side Changes

The server API must also be updated to support BLIK. Make sure your server implementation:
1. Includes 'blik' in the payment_method_types array when creating a PaymentIntent
2. Properly handles BLIK-specific payment flows and statuses

## User Experience

When a user selects BLIK payment:
1. They will see a special BLIK input field
2. After entering their BLIK code, there may be additional steps (like confirming in their bank's app)
3. The payment flow will guide them through any necessary steps
4. Upon success, they'll see the payment success UI and be redirected as normal

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting

- BLIK may not appear for non-Polish customers or for non-PLN currencies
- BLIK requires the user to have their banking app available to confirm payments
- If BLIK payments are not working, check that Stripe has been properly configured in the dashboard
- For testing, make sure you're using the correct BLIK test codes
